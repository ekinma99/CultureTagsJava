Welcome to the game #CultureTags


How to Play

The objective of the game is to guess what the #CultureTag (acronym) stands for. There are multiple ways to play.


#Teams


1. Split into teams (pick your people wisely!) of two or more. The number of teams and the number of
   people beyond two is totally up to you, although we recommend no more than 4 to team.


2. Choose a player on your team to be the describer (take turns each round).


3. When the timer starts (90 secs), the describer grabs a stack of cards from the box and immediately:
     # Announces the category and shows their team the #CultureTag
     # Gives hints without saying any of the words in the phrase
     # Puts the card down when it's answered correctly and continues flipping and giving hints
     # Passes on the cards the team can't figure out by putting them in a separate pile


4. When the timer runs out it's the next team's turn.
     # Put the remaining cards that you didn't get through back in the box
     # Leave the passed cards on the table
     # Neatly stack the cards guessed correctly and put them off to the side
     # Add one point for each card guessed correctly
     # Deduct one point for each card passed


5. Now it's the nex team's turn.
     # The describer from the next team can decide to begin with the passed cards on the table OR grab a new stack
       from the box
     # The describer is not allowed to look through the passed stack again and the decision is either all or none
     # If the describer decides to grab a new stack of cards from the box, continue playing as explained above
     # If the describer begins with the passed cards, the objective and the play is the same, but the scoring is 
       different


Unacceptable hint: When I was younger, if I asked to go to McDonalds my parents would say, you...
